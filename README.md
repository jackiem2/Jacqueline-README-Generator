  ## Description:
  This application was created to generate a README file by answering a prompt of questions when the application is ran on the terminal. I was having a difficult time setting this application up, but it was very similar to the portfolio-generator that was in the lesson so looking back at that was very helpful.

    - Acceptance Criteria:
    - GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
    - WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
        THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
    - WHEN I enter my project title
        THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
    - WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
        THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
    - WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
        THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
    - WHEN I enter my GitHub username
        THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
    - WHEN I enter my email address
        THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
    - WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
        THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
